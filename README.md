Imagine a future in which genes could be turned on or off at the flick of a switch. If we could find the underlying causes of conditional mutations we could design genes with these mutations. There are thousands upon thousands of 'lethal' alleles, but what if these are developmentally linked? Using conditional mutations we could turn genes off on mature organisms and obtain lots of new developmental data. Our project seeks to understand conditional mutations and develop a method for predicting conditional mutations of genes.

Collecting mutant allele data from various model organisms, this project seeks to explore the feasibility of finding common molecular motifs of conditional mutations. This project will require multiple phases:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Normalization and Specialization
3. Molecular Context Program
4. 3-D structure prediction
5. Automation
